        <h3>What is UI/UX?</h3>
        <p> We've all overheard conversations, walking down hip streets of the world's tech capitals,
             discussions about the great 'UX' of a product, or the poor 'UI' of a website. </P>
           
        <H3>Basics of UI !</H3>
             <P> 
                UI stands for "user interface," and it refers to the way that a user interacts with a digital product,
                such as a website or mobile app. The UI design is the process of creating the visual and interactive elements of a product, 
                such as buttons, menus, and layouts, to make it easy and efficient for users to navigate and complete their tasks.

The basics of UI design include:

   <ul type="square">
<li><span style="color: brown;"> Navigation: </span>The way users move through the product, such as menu bars, buttons, and links. <br> </li>
<li><span style="color: brown;"> Layout: </span>The way elements are arranged on the screen, such as the placement of buttons and text. <br></li>
<li><span style="color: brown;"> Interaction:</span> The way users interact with the product, such as clicking buttons, scrolling, and typing. <br></li>
<li><span style="color: brown;"> Feedback: </span>The way the product responds to user input, such as error messages and confirmation messages. <br></li>
<li><span style="color: brown;"> Typography:</span> The style and size of text used in the product. <br></li>
<li><span style="color: brown;"> Color: </span>The colors used in the product, including background colors, text colors, and button colors. <br></li>

        <h3>Know about UX !</h3>
             <p> 
                User experience (UX) design is the process of creating products, 
                such as websites or mobile apps, that are easy and enjoyable to use.
                The goal of UX design is to make sure that users can accomplish their goals efficiently and effectively,
                while also ensuring that the product is aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate.
                The basics of UX design include understanding user needs and behavior, creating user personas,
                conducting user research, creating wireframes and prototypes, and testing and iterating on designs.
                It also encompasses various design disciplines such as Interaction design, visual design and information
                architecture.
